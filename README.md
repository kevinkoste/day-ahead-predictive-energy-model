Predictive energy modeling in Python

With accurate predictions of energy demand, Yale could save money by purchasing electricity  through competitive bids on the ISO-NE day-ahead market.

Yale currently purchases electricity in real time through a procurement arrangement with the local utility company. This low-risk strategy helps ensure reliable and stable electricity, but costs more on average than the day-ahead price.

Predicting the energy demand of an individual building is notoriously difficult. However, a predictive model encompassing Yale’s entire portfolio has the potential to be quite accurate. With more than 250 buildings under management, Yale’s energy demand portfolio is diverse and nonvolatile.

The Office of Facilities has been collecting hourly electricity, chilled water, and steam data for almost five years. Until now, the data has mostly been used to identify mechanical system issues, assess energy efficiency initiatives, and bill departments for their energy consumption.

Using machine learning algorithms, the historical data can be leveraged to predict day-ahead energy demand. The model is strengthened by the inclusion of powerful predictors like date and weather data.

The scope of the energy model includes meter error identification, imputation of critical missing values, unsupervised clustering of buildings, weather & date feature engineering, and evaluation of several predictive models.
